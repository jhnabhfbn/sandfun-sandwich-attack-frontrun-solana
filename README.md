## Common Issues 📚
> ### UNSUPPORTED RPC NODE
> If you see following error in your log file:  
> `Error: 410 Gone:  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code": 410, "message":"The RPC call or parameters have been disabled."}`  
> It means your RPC node doesn't support methods needed to execute script.
> FIX: Change your RPC node. You can use Shyft, Helius or Quicknode.
> 
> ### NO TOKEN ACCOUNT
> If you see following error in your log file:  
> `Error: No SOL token account found in wallet: `  
> it means that your wallet not have USDC/WSOL token account.
> FIX: Go to [Jup.ag](https://jup.ag) and swap some SOL/USDC or SOL/WSOL.
